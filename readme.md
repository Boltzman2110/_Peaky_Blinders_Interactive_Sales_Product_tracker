#### **Methodology**
The project was implemented in three key stages:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Column Filtering**: Unnecessary columns were dropped to simplify the dataset.
   - **Normalization**: Sales data across regions were normalized to ensure consistency.
   - **Data Integration**: Rows corresponding to the same video game were merged to eliminate duplicates.
   - **Validation**: Data quality checks were performed to ensure the dataset's accuracy and reliability.

2. **Data Analysis & Insights**:
   - Regional sales performance was evaluated to understand market-specific preferences.
   - The most successful genres and publishers were identified using summary statistics.
   - Yearly sales trends were examined to determine industry growth or decline over the years.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Interactive **bar charts** and **pie charts** were created using Plotly Express to:
     - Highlight sales distribution across genres.
     - Show regional contributions to global sales.
     - Present the dominance of leading publishers.
   - Static visualizations in Matplotlib provided a high-level overview of yearly trends.
